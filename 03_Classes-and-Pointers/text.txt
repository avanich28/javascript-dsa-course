Topic: 15_Classes

- Use class to do specific things in data structure
class LinkedList {
  constructor(value) {...}
  push(value) {...}
  unshift(value) {...}
  insert(index, value) {...}
  remove(index) {...}
  pop() {...}
  shift {...}
}

Topic: Pointers (->)

let num1 = 5
let num2 = num1
num1 = 10 (num2 is still 5)

const obj1 = {
  value: 11
}

let obj2 = obj1

obj1.value = 22 (obj2.value will be 22 too.)

- If that object don't have any variables pointing to it, JS will do the process called 'Garbage Collection'.

IMPT Head and tail are not nodes.
Both of them are variables that are pointers that can point to a node.
